However, the Nutrition-Pix uploaded here is an encrypted file, and if you want to obtain the full contents of the dataset, please contact the author with e-mail.
At the same time, if you want to use this dataset to continue academic research, you are sure to cite the paper (Vision-based food segmentation via RGB-D fusion network). 
Surely, I also provide a few images of the dataset as an example here.
