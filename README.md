However, the Nutrition-Pix uploaded here is an encrypted file, and if you want to obtain the full contents of the dataset, please contact the author with e-mail.
At the same time, if you want to use this dataset to continue academic research, you are sure to cite the paper (ABCFNet: RGB-D attention-based complementary fusion
network for food semantic segmentation). Also, the code for this paper has uploaded here.
Surely, I also provide a few images of the dataset as an example here.
